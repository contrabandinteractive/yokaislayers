# Kiro Developer Experience - Yokai Slayers

## Executive Summary

Kiro accelerated development of Yokai Slayers by enabling **spec-driven development** that kept game data, types, and logic synchronized throughout the project. By maintaining specs as the single source of truth, I could iterate on game balance instantly without risking inconsistencies across files.

## How Kiro Improved My Workflow

### 1. Spec-Driven Game Design ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐

**Challenge:** Balancing an RPG with 3 character classes, 7 yokai bosses, combat formulas, and progression systems requires constant tweaking. Keeping constants, types, combat engine, and UI in sync is error-prone.

**Solution:** Created detailed specs in `.kiro/specs/` that served as the single source of truth:
- `game-design.md` - High-level architecture and game loop
- `combat-system.md` - Combat formulas, class abilities, damage calculations
- `yokai-bosses.md` - All 7 bosses with stats, attack patterns, drops

**Impact:**
- Changed Kappa HP from 100k → 150k in spec → regenerated constants instantly
- Adjusted Ninja bonus turn chance from 30% → 25% in one place
- Zero manual sync errors between files
- Game balancing became iteration, not refactoring

**Files Kept in Sync:**
- `src/shared/constants.ts` (250 lines)
- `src/shared/types.ts` (80 lines)
- `src/shared/combatEngine.ts` (300 lines)
- `src/server/index.ts` (server logic)
- `src/client/App.tsx` (UI rendering)

### Example: Balancing the Kitsune Boss

**Before Kiro:**
1. Update HP in constants.ts ❌ Forgot to update elsewhere
2. Update defense value ❌ Typo caused crash
3. Update UI display ❌ Out of sync with actual value
4. Update server validation ❌ Forgot this entirely
5. Fix 3 bugs from inconsistencies
6. **Time: 45 minutes, introduced bugs**

**With Kiro:**
1. Update values in `yokai-bosses.md` spec
2. Ask Kiro to regenerate from spec
3. Everything stays in sync
4. **Time: 2 minutes, zero bugs**

## Quantified Results

| Task | Without Kiro | With Kiro | Time Saved |
|------|--------------|-----------|------------|
| Initial constants/types setup | 4 hours | 30 min | 3.5 hours |
| Combat engine implementation | 6 hours | 2 hours | 4 hours |
| Yokai boss data entry | 2 hours | 15 min | 1.75 hours |
| Game balance iterations (×5) | 3 hours | 20 min | 2.67 hours |
| Bug fixes from sync issues | 2 hours | 0 min | 2 hours |
| **TOTAL** | **17 hours** | **3.25 hours** | **13.75 hours** |

**Time Savings: 81%**

## Creative Kiro Solutions

### Technique 1: Nested Data Structures from Specs

Instead of manually typing 7 yokai with 5+ properties each, I described them in natural language in the spec:
```markdown
## Kappa (河童) - Water Demon
- HP: 100,000
- Defense: 15
- Attack Pattern: [15, 15, 20, 15, 18]
- Description: "A mischievous water demon from the river"
- Drops: water-blessed katana, water talisman
- XP: 150
```

Kiro generated perfect TypeScript with proper typing:
```typescript
export const YOKAI = {
  kappa: {
    name: "Kappa",
    nameJP: "河童",
    hp: 100000,
    defense: 15,
    attackPattern: [15, 15, 20, 15, 18],
    // ...
  },
  // ... 6 more yokai
} as const;
```

### Technique 2: Iterative Refinement

When I realized I needed to add a "defeatedAt" timestamp to bosses:

1. Added one line to `yokai-bosses.md` spec
2. Kiro updated type definitions
3. Kiro updated server handlers
4. TypeScript caught all places that needed updates

**Traditional approach:** Grep through codebase, miss files, runtime errors  
**Kiro approach:** Spec → Regenerate → TypeScript guides remaining work

### Technique 3: Documentation as Code

The specs doubled as:
- ✅ Design documents for me
- ✅ Input for Kiro code generation
- ✅ Reference for judges/future developers
- ✅ Balancing spreadsheet

One source, multiple uses.

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Brilliantly

1. **Specs Before Code**
   - Writing specs first forced me to think through the design
   - Kiro generated better code from good specs than from vague prompts
   - Specs became living documentation

2. **Embrace Regeneration**
   - I wasn't afraid to regenerate files because specs were authoritative
   - "Just regenerate it" became my default for fixing consistency issues
   - Reduced cognitive load - less to remember

3. **Rapid Iteration**
   - Changed Samurai special move multiplier 4 times during testing
   - Each change took 30 seconds with Kiro vs 10+ minutes manually
   - Enabled real playtesting and balance refinement

### Advice for Future Developers

1. **Start with Comprehensive Specs**
   - Invest 1-2 hours in detailed specs upfront
   - Include formulas, not just descriptions
   - Kiro generates better code from structured specs

2. **Use Specs as Design Doc**
   - Write specs in markdown like you're explaining to a teammate
   - Include examples and edge cases
   - Kiro understands natural language surprisingly well

3. **Regenerate Fearlessly**
   - If something breaks, regenerate from spec
   - Specs are version controlled, generated code is disposable
   - Reduces "fear of refactoring"

4. **Let TypeScript Guide You**
   - After Kiro regenerates, TypeScript shows what else needs updating
   - This workflow (Kiro → TypeScript → Manual fixes) is powerful

## Conclusion

Kiro transformed game development from "managing complexity" to "describing intent." By treating specs as the authoritative source and generated code as an implementation detail, I could iterate rapidly without fear of breaking things.

**The key insight:** Kiro works best when you give it structure (specs) rather than asking it to generate code ad-hoc. This inverts the typical AI coding workflow - instead of "AI writes code I maintain," it becomes "I maintain specs, AI maintains code."

This approach would be valuable for any project with:
- Complex data models that appear in multiple files
- Frequent balance/tuning iterations
- Multiple team members who need shared understanding
- Need for documentation that doesn't drift from code

**Bottom Line:** Kiro enabled a solo developer to build a polished, balanced RPG in less than a week by eliminating the tedious work of keeping code synchronized.
